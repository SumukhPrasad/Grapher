# Grapher

This is a web-based grapher for equations in 2 variables.
To use the grapher, download the code and open `index.html`

This program can handle any equation (linear or not) in 2 variables, and is relatively fast. It also allows you to save your graphs as a PNG file.

## Features:
- Infinite equations (CPU's the limit!)
- Draggable points on the graph (Use the "Points" button to enable them)
- Equation Trees (To see how your equation was understood by the program, click the (i) button next to the equation.)

Finally, this is only a hobby program I made, and it's by no means anywhere near [Desmos](www.desmos.com). Just enjoy it. This isn't meant for serious work.
